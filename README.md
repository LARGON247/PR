# WhatsMyName
This repository has the unified data required to perform user and username enumeration on various websites. Content is in a JSON file and can easily be used in other projects such as the ones below:
* [Recon-ng](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng) - The [Profiler Module](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/src/7723096ce2301092906838ef73564e7907886748/modules/recon/profiles-profiles/profiler.py?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default) grabs this JSON file and uses it. See https://webbreacher.com/2014/12/11/recon-ng-profiler-module/ for details.
* [Spiderfoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot) uses this in the [sfp_account](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot/blob/master/modules/sfp_accounts.py) module. There is also [this video](https://asciinema.org/a/295923) showing how to use this project using the Spiderfoot Command Line Interface (CLI).
* [sn0int](https://github.com/kpcyrd/sn0int) downloads and uses the JSON file in the [kpcyrd/whatsmyname](https://sn0int.com/r/kpcyrd/whatsmyname) module, see https://twitter.com/sn0int/status/1228046880459907073 for details and instructions.


# Format
The format of the JSON is simple. There are 3 main elements:

1. License - The license for this project and its data
2. Authors - The people that have contributed to this project
3. Sites - This is the main data

Within the "sites" elements, the format is as follows (with several parameters being optional):

```json
     ...
      {
         "name" : "name of the site",
         "check_uri" : "URI to check the site with the {account} string replaced by a username",
         "pretty_uri" : "if the check_uri is for an API, this OPTIONAL element can show a human-readable page",
         "account_existence_code" : "the HTTP response code for a good 'account is there' response",
         "account_existence_string" : "the string in the response that we look for for a good response",
         "account_missing_string" : "this OPTIONAL string will only be in the response if there is no account found ",
         "account_missing_code" : "the HTTP response code for a bad 'account is not there' response",
         "known_accounts" : ["a list of user accounts that can be used to test","for user enumeration"],
         "category" : "a category for what the site is mainly used for",
         "valid" : "this true or false boolean field is used to enable or disable this site element"
      },
      ...
```

Here is an example of a site element:

```json
     ...
      {
         "name" : "GitHub",
         "check_uri" : "https://api.github.com/users/{account}",
         "pretty_uri" : "https://github.com/{account}",
         "account_existence_code" : "200",
         "account_existence_string" : "login:",
         "account_missing_string" : ["Not Found"],
         "account_missing_code" : "404",
         "known_accounts" : ["test","webbreacher"],
         "category" : "coding",
         "valid" : true
      },
      ...
```

# Standalone Checker
If you just want to run this script to check user names on sites and don't wish to use it in combination with another tool (like Recon-NG and/or Spiderfoot), then you can use the included Python 3 script as shown below:

```
 $  python3 ./web_accounts_list_checker.py -u sdfsfsdfsdfs
 -  161 sites found in file.
 -  Found user at http://www.break.com/user/sdfsfsdfsdfs
      ! ERROR: CONNECTION TIME OUT. Try increasing the timeout delay.

There is a bash script `whatsmyname.sh` in the repository that uses Zenity to run the Python standalone checker.
